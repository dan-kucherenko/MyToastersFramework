    @State private var items = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]
    @State private var recentlyDeletedItem: (index: Int, name: String)?

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List {
                ForEach(items.indices, id: \.self) { index in
                    Text(items[index])
                        .swipeActions {
                            Button(role: .destructive) {
                                deleteItem(at: index)
                            } label: {
                                Label("Delete", systemImage: "trash")
                            }
                        }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Manage Items")
        }
    }

    private func deleteItem(at index: Int) {
        let deletedItem = items.remove(at: index)
        recentlyDeletedItem = (index, deletedItem)

        let toast = Toast(
            text: "Item '\(deletedItem)' deleted. Undo?",
            image: UIImage(systemName: "exclamationmark.triangle.fill")!,
            buttonTitle: "Undo",
            buttonAction: {
                if let item = recentlyDeletedItem {
                    items.insert(item.name, at: item.index)
                    recentlyDeletedItem = nil
                }
            },
